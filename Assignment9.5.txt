1.The core components of flume:
The components are 
	*Source
	*Channels and
	*Sink.
*Flume source:
	It receives event from external sources,it stores event in one or multiple
channels.
*Flume channel:
	It temporarily stores and keeps the event until it is consumed by the flume
sink.
	It acts as flume repository.
*Flume sink:
	It removes the event from channel and put into an external repository like HDFS 
or
 move to next flume agent.

2. Can flume provide 100% reliability while transfering the data:
    Yes, Apache Flume provides end to end reliability because of its transactional approach 
in 
data flow.

3.The consolidation in flume:
*It collect data from different sources even from different flume agents.

*Flume source can collect all data flow from different sources and flows through channel 
and sink
and send this data to HDFS or target destination.


4.An event in flume:
*A unit of data with set of string attributes called flume event.

*The external source like web-server sends events to the source.
*Flume has internal built in functions to understand source format.

5.An agent in flume:
*A flume agent is a JVM process that holds the flume core components like source,channel and sink

through which event flows from an external source like web-servers to destination like HDFS.
*An agent is heart of apache flume.
